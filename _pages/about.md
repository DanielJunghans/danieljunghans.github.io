**Hello!** My name is Daniel Junghans. I am a Treasury Analyst on the Asset Liability Management Team for Fifth Third Bank. Interests include finance, banking, and data analytics. I am skilled in Microsoft Office applications, Python 3, SQL, R, Tableau, and PowerBI. 

In December of 2021, I graduated with honor from Michigan State University's [Eli Broad College of Business](https://broad.msu.edu/) with a Bachelor of Arts in Finance. During my time as a student, I enjoyed participating in extracurriculars and learning about banking. I was a Co-Portfolio Manager for the [Student Investment Association](https://www.msusia.org/) throughout my Senior year.
